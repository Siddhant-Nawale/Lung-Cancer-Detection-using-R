# Lung Cancer Detection with Data Science using R - Decision Tree, RandomForest, and SVM

## Description

This data science mini project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms, specifically Decision Tree, RandomForest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to detect lung cancer based on relevant health indicators. The goal is to build and compare models that can assist in early identification and classification of individuals at risk of lung cancer.
